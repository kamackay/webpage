# Program 3

None of the extra credits have been done, but all of the main functionality of the requirements is present. The colored triangle and sphere are drawn using a texture loaded from the color that was provided as their diffuse color.

Note: I curved the alphas so that some of the objects would be more visible against the dark background without having to be the selected object.
